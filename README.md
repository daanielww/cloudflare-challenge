DOCUMENTATION

For EXTRA CREDIT I've added support for both ipv6 and ipv4


Please only have 1 of either "-4" or "-6" flag, for the ipv4 and ipv6 configs respectively


Note: Sudo permissions may be necessary


Example Commands:
sudo go run main.go -6 -ip=2001:4860:4860::8888


sudo go run main.go -4 -ip=8.8.8.8
